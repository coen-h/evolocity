                    Start planning out your build, do you want to build
                    a 4 wheel kart, a trike / reverse trike, or even a 
                    2 wheel electric bike.

                <p>2 - Start your build!</p>
                <p>
                    Start making your frame and slowly adding on parts
                    until you have a complete kart with a electric motor
                    and brakes.

                <p>
                    Bring your kart to the race in November and compete
                    against other schools to prove your kart is the best!
