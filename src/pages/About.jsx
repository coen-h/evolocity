            <h1>EVolocity – The EV programme changing futures</h1>
            <h3>Our mission is to break down barriers and inspire rangatahi into sustainable 
                engineering while fast-forwarding New Zealand’s clean tech future.</h3>
            <p>
                At EVolocity, we are building more than just electric vehicles – 
                we’re building the next generation of innovators, along with the skills 
                they need to make a positive impact on their future, and the world they live in. 
                Our programme envisions a cleaner, more resilient future where every young Kiwi 
                can be a leader in sustainable technologies.
            </p>
            <h3>STUDENTS DESIGN, BUILD, RACE</h3>
            <h4>School-age students design, build and compete with their own electric vehicles.</h4>
            <p>
                Year 7 to 13 age teams or individuals build a vehicle (either a bike or with 3+ wheels) 
                powered by a standard 350W electric motor, controller and two 12V gel cells. Innovation 
                is encouraged as students strive to make their vehicle the fastest with the least drag, 
                and able to cope with the demands of a tight street circuit. The Engineering Design Award 
                encourages teams to build innovative features, such as smart monitoring or object detection 
                and avoidance.
            </p>
            <h3>WORKSHOPS PACKED WITH EXPERT ADVICE + PRACTICAL SUPPORT</h3>
            <h4>Students & teachers gain access to tertiary & specialist tutors at a series of workshops during the year.</h4>
            <p>
                Each year we work with teachers and club leaders to build a calendar of events for their region. 
                This includes a Launch Day, welding workshops, CAD Design and Arduino programming. Each build day 
                has a focus to assist students throughout their build: from team planning to vehicle design and 
                fabrication, electronics and programming, then scrutineering and testing. The events are usually 
                held in the weekend or evenings, are interactive, a bunch of fun, and if we’re lucky, include 
                free pizza! Parents are encouraged to attend and participate. Events are often hosted by our 
                tertiary partners and led by their specialist staff. Our workshops are an excellent way to see 
                where your rivals are at and even borrow an idea or two, and teams are encouraged to help one 
                another with materials and expertise.
            </p>
            <h3>RACE + COMPETE</h3>
            <p>EVolocity Regional Finals see teams go head-to-head at the end of the year – competing in 
                various categories, including performance, innovation and design.
            </p>
            <p>Our regional finals are a fun day of competition where teams showcase their designs and test 
                their vehicles on the track against their peers from other schools and clubs. The action-packed 
                day consists of drag racing, gymkhana/slalom, efficiency and endurance challenges alongside 
                ‘just for fun’ racing experiences. As well as racing awards, special awards are up for grabs 
                that recognise achievements in innovation, engineering excellence, sustainability, and overall 
                team/vehicle theme.
            </p>
            <p>Regional Finals are open to the public and are a great opportunity for everyone to check out 
                the world of EV racing!
